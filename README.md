PROGRAM PROJECT 1
RUN BY COMMAND: ./PROJECT1 NAMEOFTESTFILE.TXT
OR BY COMMAND: CAT ./PROJECT1 NAMEOFTESTFILE.TXT
READS FROM EITHER STDIN OR BY INPUT FILE
A BUG OCCURS FROM THE FSCANF FOR INPUT FILE WHEN ARGC > 1
THE BUG IS THAT THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE FILE IS ERASED FROM THE BUFFER ARRAY AFTER READING IS COMPLETED
THIS IS CURRENTLY BYPASSED BY MAKING A TEMPORARY HOLDER FOR THE VALUE AND ADDING IT LATER
THERE ARE NO KNOWN OTHER BUGS AT THE MOMENT
FIRST RUN MAKE ALL
THEN IT WILL CREATE A FILE CALLED PROJECT1
COMPILE THE CODE WITH EITHER CAT OR <
EXAMPLE: CAT ./PROJECT1 TEST.TXT
EXAMPLE: ./PROJECT1 < TEST.TXT
THE FIRST FUNCTION READS IN THE FILE
THE SECOND FUNCTION WILL ALLOCATE VALUES READ INTO AN ARRAY
THE NEXT FUNCTION WILL APPEND NUMBERS THAT AR ELONGER THAN 1 DIGIT USING CUSTOM ALGORITHM
THE NEXT SET OF FUNCTIONS WILL PUT PID AND BURST TIME INTO RESPECTIVE ARRAYS
THE NEXT FUNCTIONS CALCULATE VALUES NEEDED FOR PROJECT1
